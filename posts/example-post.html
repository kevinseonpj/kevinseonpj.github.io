easily without setting anything up. However, I did end up running into performance issues in collecting and parsing the information
for the input players and storing the data as a method of cacheing for the future. I could always speed this up by just scraping the
website such as opgg which already stores numerous player data already, but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to tackle the modeling and
calculation (which I actually I look forward to doing once I get some time on it) So I will come back to that once I do have some more time.</p><p>In the mean time, I will probably try to contribute to more well established league prediction projects such as <a href="https://github.com/JohnsonJDDJ/zilean">zilean</a>
(although it&#x27;s a different method than what I was going for but in a similar directions), and include some cool things I found while interacting with Riot API here in the future.

<Image
  alt={`yuumi`}
  src={`/images/bridge.jpg`}
  width={640}
  height={360}
  priority
/>

## Simple Usage

Now this image above me isn't loading probably... It was working perfectly fine few days ago with the same code as below.
But now it's going wack... which is fine but also annoying. I'll figure it out when I have the time next time >.>

```jsx:example-post.mdx
<Image
  alt={`yuumi`}
  src={`/images/bridge.jpg`}
  width={640}
  height={360}
  priority
/>
```

### Code Blocks

This starter also comes with fancy code blocks with code titles.

```jsx:example.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Riot API

At the beginning of summer, I decided to look more into the dev side of Riot's game (mostly in League of Legends)
since I really enjoyed the game, but no one can survive constant gaming on the rift... unless, you are Tyler1, of course.

Anyways, I wanted to see how popular tools like op.gg, u.gg, and other popular tools were collecting their information. My plan was to
mimic similar basic information collection (which I ended up doing without too much problem) and use those informations to train and
do some simple modeling using sklearn or something similar to predict game outcomes.

The Riot APIs were pretty straight forward to use thanks to their dev portal that allows you to test API calls
easily without setting anything up. However, I did end up running into performance issues in collecting and parsing the information
for the input players and storing the data as a method of cacheing for the future. I could always speed this up by just scraping the
website such as opgg which already stores numerous player data already, but I haven't had the chance to tackle the modeling and
calculation (which I actually I look forward to doing once I get some time on it) So I will come back to that once I do have some more time.

In the mean time, I will probably try to contribute to more well established league prediction projects such as [zilean](https://github.com/JohnsonJDDJ/zilean)
(although it's a different method than what I was going for but in a similar directions), and include some cool things I found while interacting with Riot API here in the future.
(I am talking about stuff like how they call Wukong as 'monkeyking' in their json data and etc, but I'll come back!)

## Image Problem (off-topic)

This is just a completely off-topic paragraph, but if anyone knows why I can't load images using the Image component from nextjs
let me know. I'm using it like the following, and again I'm not the most js person so... >.> It used to work, but I must've messed some configuration somewhere.

```jsx:example-post.mdx
<Image
  alt={`image`}
  src={`/images/image.jpg`}
  width={640}
  height={360}
  priority
/>
```

I will be exploring the definition of a hero and how Odysseus fits and also how he has been redefined if any at all. And Lastly what this difference in his heroism says about the cultural values within the context? So let's begin with the definition of a hero. Merriam-Webster defines them to be more general as \u201ca mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability\u201d while Oxford Classical Dictionary defines them to be \u201ca class of beings worshipped by the Greeks, generally conceived as the powerful dead, and often as forming a class intermediate between gods and men\u201d.

So it is clear that Odysseus deserves his title of Hero in his ability to be cunning and clever in his journey and his connection to the Gods. The definition that I lean toward is the Merriam-Webster definition. Then why is it that sometimes we don't see Odysseus as a hero? Why is it that this question was even asked? Well, I think it lies in the development and the redefined characterization of heroes in our modern times. Let's take a look at some of the heroes that we see in our modern times in pictures, and see what that tells us about the cultural values and how it has changed since the time of the Greeks.

I think we are initially obsessed with the physical prowess of the heroes, and that's purely due to how most of us grow up  loving the idea of becoming a powerful character saving the world, and it's often harder to see looking up to intelligence in any context. It is also apparent that many modern fantasies and media have created a diverging identity of some of the heroes. One of the biggest and the most obvious  examples is Percy Jackson. Many people often don't even know that Perseus is the son of Zeus, and as you saw from some of the AI generations, many images  have shown that mix of truth and modern fantasy.

We have heavily moved past the simple idea of power from  the growth of technology, health, and education. This is more apparent in our society where we appreciate many working-class heroes such as doctors, nurses, teachers, etc.  However, even beyond that, we began to see heroes in fantasy such as Marvel that address leadership, and intelligence as their identity and not just extreme physical prowess. I would even argue Captain America is one of the heroes that fall into these categories. I think these changes in our cultural values have changed how we perceive Odysseus as a hero. Even though Odysseus was often seen as the hero partly due to his Godly connection since cultural values at the time heavily valued this, now we are able to redefine his position as a hero beyond just his connection, but instead through his character and strength in leadership and intelligence.
